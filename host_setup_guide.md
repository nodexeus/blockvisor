# BlockVisor Host Setup Guide

## Prerequisites

 - `bvup` tool (see assets bellow)
 - `PROVISION_TOKEN` obtained from Nodexeus portal

### OS Requirements

BV doesn't require any particular linux distribution, but it is recommended to use:
`Ubuntu Server 18.04+`

BV requires Linux kernel 5.10+.

### Install BV Dependencies

Beside standard linux tool available in all distributions, BV requires following CLI tools to be available:

- `pigz`
- `tar`
- `systemctl`
- `ip`

For _Ubuntu_ based distributions:

```shell
apt update
apt install pigz util-linux e2fsprogs chrony
```

### Install Apptainer

See [Installing Apptainer](https://apptainer.org/docs/admin/main/installation.html#install-ubuntu-packages)
Required version is 1.3.0
In case of any issues, try to build apptainer [from sources](https://apptainer.org/docs/admin/main/installation.html#install-from-source). 

### Network Setup

BV uses Apptainer to run protocol nodes, it requires bridge interface to be configured. 
If bridge interface name is different thant default `br0`, then it must be explicitly passed to `bvup`
when provisioning(see `bvup --help` for more details).

**Example:**

There are multiple ways to configure network depending on linux distribution and user preferences.

Below is example of `netplan` configuration:

```yaml
network:
  version: 2
  renderer: networkd
  ethernets:
    enp33s0:
      dhcp4: false
      dhcp6: false
  bridges:
    br0:
      interfaces: [ enp33s0 ]
      addresses: [ 50.115.46.98/28 ]
      gateway4: 50.115.46.97
      nameservers:
        search: [ hosted.static.webnx.com ]
        addresses:
            - "1.1.1.1"
            - "8.8.8.8"
      parameters:
        stp: false
        forward-delay: 1
      dhcp4: no
      dhcp6: no
```
- Apply netplan configuration `netplan apply`
- Verify that the bridge `br0` is the primary interface
- Reboot the server. Verify the network configuration persists through reboot and the server is reachable.

## Host Provisioning with `bvup`

Once everything described above is configured, run `bvup` to provision host and install BV: 

```sh
./bvup <PROVISION_TOKEN> [--region REGION]
```
where `<PROVISION_TOKEN>` is token obtained from Nodexeus portal.

See `bvup --help` for more details.

### Verify Installation 
After successfully running `bvup`, verify the config file is present within `/etc/blockvisor.json`
and run the following command to verify `BV` service status: 
```shell
systemctl status blockvisor.service
```

## [optional] Check auto-update

BV auto-update can be disabled (enabled by default)
by setting the following field in `/etc/blockvisor.json` config file:
```json
"update_check_interval_secs": null
```

Remember to stop BV service before changing config file:
```shell
bv stop
... modify /etc/blockvisor.json ...
bv start
```
